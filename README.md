# Telemedicine-use-during-the-pandemic

Research Question: Who has had a telemedicine (virtual) appointment with a doctor, nurse, or other medical personnel during the pandemic?

I wanted to look at a larger dataset and found one online from a governmental survey called the Home Pulse Survey. See, https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/data.html

It's almost a longitudinal study of what is happening to Americans during the pandemic.

I found some data on telemedicine and was thrilled to drill down further. I am using SQL Server, SSMS, RStudio, Excel, and Tableau and will document what I do as I work
through this project.

I'm really interested to see the trends of how many people had virtual medical appointments in 2021.

I've included the Excel files for each week of the study, the Sql I wrote, the R I wrote, and the Tableau files are here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sara.kubik/viz/TelemedicineDuringthePandemic/
