# Telemedicine-use-during-the-pandemic

Research Question: Who has had a telemedicine (virtual) appointment with a doctor, nurse, or other medical personnel during the pandemic?

I wanted to look at a larger dataset and found one online from a governmental survey called the Home Pulse Survey. See, https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/data.html

It's almost a longitudinal study of what is happening to Americans during the pandemic.

I found some data on telemedicine and was thrilled to drill down further. I am using SQL Server, SSMS, RStudio, Excel, and Tableau and will document what I do as I work
through this project.

I'm really interested to see the trends of how many people had virtual medical appointments in 2021.
